            After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to
            make people happy, one topping at a time.
            Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style
            pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s
            family on the go.
            Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch
            sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy
            Flax crust.
            You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're
            always ready to make you more.
